NotNotchFilter
==============

NotNotchFilter is a performance-oriented filter designed to replace the mid-EQ
found in a standard 3-band DJ mixer. The key advantage of this filter is that
it cleanly cuts out single voices or instruments in a track, whereas a
standard 3-band filter dampens them. This is because NotNotchFilter, as the
name suggests, is not actually a notch filter. Rather, it is a combination of
a hipass and lopass filter which work on opposite sides of the target
frequency.

Usage
-----

For optimal use, use NotNotchFilter with two knobs, one to control the base
frequency and the other to control the filter width. When the width is set to
zero, then the filter will be 100% dry.

If you don't have two spare knobs on your controller of choice, then assign a
single knob to the filter width and set the base frequency to something in the
mid-hi range. You'll probably need to experiment a bit to find a good
frequency which suits your style of play, but having a spare knob to control
the base frequency is preferred as this allows one to adjust it on the fly to
filter out a given instrument in the track.
